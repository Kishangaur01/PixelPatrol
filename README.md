# PixelPatrol
This project focuses on detecting fake, tampered, or manipulated images using machine learning techniques. With the growing availability of image editing tools and AI-generated media, verifying the authenticity of images has become critical.
Our solution leverages feature extraction, classical machine learning algorithms, and/or deep learning models to analyze images and classify them as either real or fake.

Key Features:

Preprocessing and feature extraction from input images.

Machine Learning models trained to distinguish real and fake images.

Support for classification of different types of image forgeries (e.g., image splicing, copy-move).
